# Credit Score Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether an individual will have "good" or "bad" performance in terms of creditworthiness. The model utilizes various features such as age, credit amount, credit history, employment status, and housing to make predictions. 

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Pickle
- Matplotlib (for visualization, if included)

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
- Model training: Utilizes Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers.
- Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizes model performance using GridSearchCV.
- Model evaluation: Outputs accuracy and classification reports.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `pickle`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd credit-score-prediction
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Data
The dataset used in this project can be found in `data/data.csv`. It includes various features that influence credit performance, labeled as "good" (1) or "bad" (0).

### Usage
1. **Train the Model**:
   Run the model training script to train the classifier.
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

2. **Make Predictions**:
   Use the saved model to make predictions on new data.
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

### Results
The model's performance metrics, including accuracy and classification report, will be displayed in the console after training.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building a machine learning model for credit score prediction, encompassing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
